    "description1": "Hand-cut, hand-placed, and hand-polished — Moroccan zellige is more than tile. It’s a living tradition born in the imperial city of Fes, where master artisans have shaped clay and pigment for over a thousand years. Every piece carries slight variations that reflect true craftsmanship — no two tiles are ever the same.",
    "description2": "Renowned for its luminous glaze, intricate patterns, and unmatched durability, zellige transforms any surface into a work of art. Choosing zellige isn’t just choosing tile — it’s choosing a legacy of beauty, culture, and authenticity that never goes out of style.",
